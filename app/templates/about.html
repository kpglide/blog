	<p>I currently work as in-house counsel for <a href="http://www.turner.com/brands/turner-sports" target="_blank">Turner Sports</a>.  This blog is a small hobby project that I built because I was interested in learning more about programming and web development.  It uses<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a> web framework.  Thanks for checking it out.</p>
